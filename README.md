# Capstone-Projects
# 🗂️1. Data Analysis Essentials using Google Colab Masterclass💸
This folder represents my **Sales Data Capstone Project**, completed as part of the **“Data Analysis Essentials using Google Colab Master Class”** offered by **Excelerate** website(USA) under **"Rochester Institute of Technology"** University. The project focuses on applying end-to-end data analytics techniques to uncover key business insights and revenue patterns.

# 📊 Project Overview

    • Dataset: "Sales_Transactions_3500.csv"
    • Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Excel
    • Platform: Google Colab
    • Focus Areas: Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Visualization, and Insight Generation

# 🗓️ Task Breakdown

    • Day 1: Data cleaning, validation, and preparation for analysis
    • Day 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — identifying trends, patterns, and distributions
    • Day 3: Visualization of regional and category revenue patterns through advanced charts

# 🎯 Outcome
This capstone project demonstrates the complete analytical workflow — from raw data to insight-driven storytelling. It highlights proficiency in using Python for business data exploration, enabling actionable decisions and strategic sales optimization.

# 🗂️2.Introduction to AI-Powered Data Visualization Workshop

This folder contains my complete project for the **“Introduction to AI-Powered Data Visualization Workshop”** , where I created two full dashboards using two different AI tools and datasets. The goal of the workshop was to understand how AI can support dataset creation, visualization planning, dashboard design, and insight generation across multiple platforms.

# 📊 Project Summary
## 🔹 Dashboard 1: Netflix Content Analytics (Power BI)
    •Dataset: "Netflix Shows" from Kaggle
    •Tool Used: Power BI
    •Objective: Analyze Netflix’s global content patterns—including genre spread, maturity ratings, country contributions, and time-based release trends.

### Key Focus Areas:
    •Dataset generation through AI
    •KPI selection & visualization planning
    •Creating trend, distribution, and comparison-based charts
    •Insight-driven storytelling using small datasets

🗓️ Task Breakdown
    •Selected two AI tools (Power BI & ChatGPT Visualization Expert)
    •Chose two unrelated datasets (one real, one AI-generated)
    •Defined KPIs, filters, and dashboard structure
    •POWER BI-Dashboard Development
    •Built complete NFT dashboard in Power BI
    •Designed visualizations, slicers, KPI cards, and reports
    •AI-Based Dashboard Creation
    •Generated the space mission dataset using ChatGPT
    •Designed visuals & insights entirely inside ChatGPT Visualization Expert environment

### 🎯 Outcome
This project demonstrates the power of AI in modern analytics workflows. It showcases:
    • Multi-tool dashboard creation
    • AI-assisted dataset generation
    • Visualization planning using prompts
    • Analytical storytelling based on KPIs, trends, and filters
    • Ability to work across structured and AI-fabricated datasets
By completing two dashboards with different datasets and tools, this workshop enhanced my skills on how AI can accelerate data preparation, visualization, and insight generation with minimal manual. overhead.
